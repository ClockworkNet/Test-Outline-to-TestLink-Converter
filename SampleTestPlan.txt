// This is a test case document sample illustrating how to structure a test case.  Tabs are unimportant, and just for making things look organized.
// Use a key (+ , - , =) to set up a test case.  You must keep this structure, however, or it will barf. 
// Test Case is the minimum required, but Summary, Test Steps and Expected Results must be contained underneath a test case.  
// C-style (//) and shell-style (# ) comments are both currently respected.
// Blank lines are ignored.  Always put a space after your key character.
