== About ==

Some background on this project can be found at the Clockwork.net blog.  

Here's a handy link:

http://www.clockwork.net/blog/2011/12/19/547/test_plans_testlink_and_adventures_in_php

== Sample Usage ==

There is a sample test plan available in SampleTestPlan.txt.  To see what the XML will look like, run the following from the command line.

    ./TestOutlineConverter.php SampleTestPlan.txt SampleTestPlan.xml
    
You will be prompted for a test plan name.  You can avoid the prompt by adding a name for the Test Plan as a third argument, however, spaces must be escaped to be respected.

== To import into TestLink: ==

    1. Log into your TestLink instance.  
    2. Proceed to "Edit Test Cases".  
    3. Select the folder level you'd like to import your test plan to.
    4. Select "Import Test Suite"
    5. Upload the generated XML file that was created
    6. Add your test cases to a test plan and execute
    
Please see the constraints section in the bottom of this document for known limitations. 

== Basic Usage: ==

This is a command line PHP script that requires an INFILE and an OUTFILE.
Optionally, a third argument can be supplied for a Test Plan name.

  Usage:
  ./TestOutlineConverter.php <INFILE> <OUTFILE> <TESTPLAN NAME>

  <INFILE> Source of your test cases
  
  <OUTFILE> The XML file, formatted for TestLink 
  
  <TESTPLAN NAME>  This will be your test plan name.  If it is not set, you will be prompted for it.
  
  
  Notes for test outline creation:
  	+	Starting a line with '+ ' creates a test case with the 
  		rest of the line
  ~ '~ ' Denotes a Precondition. Preconditions are each displayed on their own line.
	-	'- ' Denotes a Test Step
	=	'= ' Denotes Expected Results.  If no associated step exists, 
		a blank step is created.
	//	Comment out a line with '//'
	# 	Comment out a line with '# '
	{ <SUITE NAME>  Opens a test suite or folder in TestLink.  
	                Each test plan must start with one of these. 
	                If there is no name, you will be prompted.
	}   Closes a test suite or folder in TestLink.  
	
	[no line prefix] 
		No Line prefix means it will get entered into the Test Case
		'Summary' in Test Link.  Basic HTML elements are safe here.
		
	[blank lines]
		Blank lines will be ignored.
	
	
	Always follow the key character with a space.  
    
== Constraints and Limitations ==

Test Plans work best when they're created in a specific order.  Here's how one should look:

{ Test Plan/Suite Name (One line, starts with '{')
+ Test Case Name (always starts with '+ ', no HTML or line breaks allowed)
    Summary information.  The summary can accept HTML, and line breaks are fine, however, summary info can only exist immediately after a test case.
    ~ Precondition information.
    - First Test Step (always starts with '- ') (HTML is Safe now, line breaks are not)
        = Expected results (starts with '= ', HTML Safe, line breaks, no)
}
